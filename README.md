♻ IoT Enabled Waste Management System

🧩 Project Overview

The IoT Enabled Waste Management System is a smart solution designed to improve waste collection and segregation efficiency. Using IoT (Internet of Things) technology, this system automatically detects and categorizes waste into dry and wet types. It aims to promote eco-friendly waste management practices and reduce human intervention.

⚡ How It Works

1. The sensors detect whether the incoming waste is dry or wet.
2. Based on sensor readings, the system categorizes the waste and directs it to the correct bin.
3. IoT module sends status data to the cloud or displays it locally.
4. This ensures smart and hygienic waste management with minimal human effort.

🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Install the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect your IoT board (e.g., Arduino Uno or NodeMCU).
3. Upload the code from "dry_wet.ino".
4. Attach the required sensors (moisture, ultrasonic, etc.).
5. Power on and observe the automatic segregation process.
